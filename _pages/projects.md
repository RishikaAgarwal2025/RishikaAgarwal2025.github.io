## 1. Forecasting Tata Motors' Stock Price using Nifty 50

This project involved building a time series forecasting model to predict Tata Motors’ stock price based on trends in the Nifty 50 index. Using ARIMA modeling in Stata, I performed stationarity testing, applied double differencing, and selected the optimal model using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). The analysis, based on annual average closing prices from 2012 to 2022, forecasts a temporary decline in 2024 followed by a long-term upward trend. This work demonstrates my ability to apply statistical modeling techniques to uncover macroeconomic influences on firm-level performance, with hands-on experience in data preprocessing (Excel), model evaluation, and time series forecasting.
