## 1. Forecasting Tata Motors' Stock Price using Nifty 50

**Description**: This project applies ARIMA modeling to predict Tata Motors’ average annual closing price using historical Nifty 50 data (2012–2022).

**Files**:
- [Forecasting Code](../assets/Time_series_econometrics/Forecasting-code.txt)
- [Research Paper (PDF)](../assets/Time_series_econometrics/Forecasting_stock_market.pdf)
- [Dataset](../assets/Time_series_econometrics/Tata-motors-nifty50.xlsx)

**Skills**: Forecasting, time series modeling  
**Tools**: Excel, Word, Stata  
**Key Insights**: The ARIMA model suggests a decline in 2024, followed by increases. BIC was used for model selection; double differencing proved most effective.

## 2. Data Management – SQL Simulation for Subscription Business

**Description**: Simulates a subscription-based magazine company (BABA) by designing a schema, generating synthetic data, and extracting insights using SQL.

**Files**:
- [Faker Python Code](../assets/Data_Management/Code/Fake_data_code.py)
- [Project Report (PDF)](../assets/Data_Management/Report/Data_Management_Report.pdf)

**Skills**: SQL database design, synthetic data generation, analytics  
**Tools**: Python (pandas, faker), SQL, PowerPoint  
**Key Insights**: Demonstrates the utility of database simulation in identifying trends in customer behavior, revenue, and engagement, despite synthetic constraints.
