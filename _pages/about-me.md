Hi, I’m Rishika Agarwal, currently pursuing a Master’s in Business Analytics at the University of Warwick. I have a strong foundation in data analysis, forecasting, and optimization, built through both academic projects and internships.

I’m passionate about turning data into actionable insights and am actively seeking opportunities as a Business Analyst.
