I’m a data-driven thinker with a creative edge, combining a foundation in Economics and Mathematics with an MSc in Business Analytics at the University of Warwick. What excites me most isn’t just the numbers themselves, but the systems they reflect and the smarter decisions they enable.

My academic and project experience has been a blend of rigor and relevance. I’ve used models like ARIMA to forecast stock prices, simulated EMS systems using AnyLogic, visualized wage data with Tableau, and evaluated real-world policies through hands-on research in areas like policing, public health, and crime statistics. Whether working on a team or independently, I bring a structured yet adaptive approach to solving problems with data.

What grounds my analytical mindset is a personal curiosity shaped by contrast. Years of arts education taught me to be intuitive with ambiguity. Chess sharpened my strategy and foresight. Volunteering, from tree planting to donation drives, reminded me that meaningful impact starts with consistency and care.

Professionally, I’m passionate about bridging the gap between insight and action, translating data into decisions that are commercially intelligent, socially aware, and future-ready. I’m especially interested in domains where data intersects with strategic planning, forecasting, and ethical innovation.

Looking ahead, I aim to deepen my expertise in advanced analytics, machine learning, and data storytelling, while continuously improving how I communicate complex ideas clearly and impactfully. I thrive in environments where learning is constant, challenges are real, and outcomes truly matter.
