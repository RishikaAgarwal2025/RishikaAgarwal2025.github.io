I’m a data-driven thinker with a creative edge, grounded in a strong foundation in Economics and Mathematics and currently completing an MSc in Business Analytics at the University of Warwick. What excites me most isn’t just the numbers, but the systems they reflect, the human behavior they represent, and the smarter decisions they can empower.

My academic and project experience has combined analytical rigor with real-world relevance. I’ve forecasted stock prices using ARIMA models, simulated Emergency Medical Services (EMS) systems in AnyLogic, visualized wage data with Tableau, and evaluated public policies through hands-on research in policing, public health, and crime statistics. Whether working independently or in teams, I bring a structured yet adaptive approach to solving complex problems with data.

This mindset is grounded in a curiosity shaped by contrast. Years of arts education taught me to be intuitive with ambiguity. Playing chess has sharpened my strategic thinking and foresight. Volunteering, from planting trees to organizing donation drives, has reminded me that meaningful impact begins with consistency, empathy, and purpose.

Professionally, I’m passionate about bridging the gap between insight and action, translating data into decisions that are commercially intelligent, socially responsible, and future-focused. I’m especially interested in fields where analytics intersects with strategic planning, forecasting, and ethical innovation.

Looking ahead, I aim to deepen my expertise in advanced analytics, machine learning, and data storytelling, while continuously improving how I communicate complex ideas clearly and impactfully. I thrive in environments where learning is continuous, challenges are meaningful, and outcomes matter.
