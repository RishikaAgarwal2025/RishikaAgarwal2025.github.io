**Enhancing Efficiency and Societal Impact of Ahmedabad‚Äôs BRTS**                                                                                                                                                                                                           
My final-year dissertation focused on making Ahmedabad‚Äôs Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS) more efficient, inclusive, and environmentally sustainable. Although BRTS was introduced as a rapid and eco-friendly public transport option, it remains significantly underutilized‚Äîespecially among students and urban professionals.

**üîç Research Objective**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
The goal was to understand why BRTS usage is low and to identify what changes‚Äîin infrastructure, policy, or user experience‚Äîcould improve its adoption. I aimed to propose actionable interventions that could encourage a shift from private vehicles to public transport.

**üõ† Methodology**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
I began with a behavioral survey conducted at Ahmedabad University to understand travel choices, perceptions of BRTS, and barriers to adoption. The findings were then used to simulate six real-world transportation scenarios using SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility), an open-source traffic modeling software.

These simulations tested variables such as traffic volume, emissions, waiting times, and the impact of switching to electric buses. Each case compared different combinations of BRTS, AMTS, and private vehicle usage.

**üí° Key Insights**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
The research revealed that over 60% of respondents preferred private vehicles due to poor last-mile connectivity and time inefficiency in using BRTS. However, if waiting time, safety, and connectivity were improved, a significant number of users expressed willingness to switch.

Simulation results showed a clear reduction in emissions and travel times when public transport was optimized‚Äîespecially with the introduction of electric buses and integrated corridors.

**üìã Policy Recommendations**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Based on my findings, I proposed several low-cost, high-impact strategies to increase BRTS usage:

- Introduce free or discounted BRTS rides for students and women
- Raise parking fees near university areas
- Add electric carts or rickshaws for last-mile connectivity
- Convert existing AMTS buses to electric and integrate them into BRTS corridors
                                                                                                                                                                            
These recommendations align with Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 11 and SDG 13) by promoting equitable, low-emission urban transportation.

**üß† Tools & Skills Used**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
I worked with SUMO for traffic simulation and mobility modeling, SPSS for survey analysis, and Google Forms for public data collection. The project also involved research in urban transport policy and behavioral insights related to commuting choices.

**‚úÖ Conclusion**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
This project helped me combine urban planning, human behavior, and data-driven simulation to design practical transport solutions. It strengthened my passion for mobility systems that are sustainable, inclusive, and smart‚Äîand deepened my skills in research, policy design, and urban mobility planning.
