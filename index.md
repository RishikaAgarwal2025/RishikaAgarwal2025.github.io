### ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!

When I first discovered how a few lines of Python could automate hours of manual work, I knew Iâ€™d found my path. Since then, Iâ€™ve been driven by one question: how can data make smarter business decisions?

Iâ€™m Rishika Agarwal, currently pursuing an MSc in Business Analytics at the University of Warwick. With a background in Economics and Mathematics, and hands-on skills in Python, SQL, and Tableau, Iâ€™ve built solutions that turn messy data into powerful insights.

Whether it's improving processes, uncovering trends, or driving data-backed decisions, I bring curiosity, structure, and a people-first mindset to every project.

Explore my academic journey, analytical projects, teaching experience, and dissertation, all through the navigation bar above. I'm actively seeking full-time opportunities as a Business Analyst, Data Analyst, or Pricing Analyst in dynamic, problem-solving environments.
